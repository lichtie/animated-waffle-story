	Marianne was working in the corner of a cafe late on a Thursday night. 
She was meant to be working on the copy for a new client at her advertising
firm, but she had spent the past few hours frustratedly procrastinating. She
had, in truth, been spending her time doodling mindlessly in a MSPaint 
document. Over the years, her passion for her job had fallen, and she had 
found it harder and harder to keep her concentration. She knew that
eventually she would have to find a way to focus or she'd be fired, but that
didn't give any insight into how to do it. She put her laptop away and left
the cafe. 
	And so she went to work next day expecting the worst; expecting to
get fired. However, that was not what happened surprisingly. It turns out 
there was this big pyramid scheme that got a whole bunch of people arrested
or fired. Pretty much everyone was in this scheme except Marianne. It felt
a bit wierd that almost everyone was gone. This scheme pretty mucha allowed
Marianne to avoid the getting fired. There was vote held to see who would be 
the new boss, and Marianne won! Wow! She was going to make a lot of changes
to this office.
	"First things first," she thought to herself. Marianne opened up her
laptop and drew in the last few details of the doodle she began the day before.
After those final touches, Marianne brainstormed a few of the changes she needed
to make. Her second order of business was to fix up her advertising firm's image
and business model, which had all but been destroyed by the pyramid scheme.  
	They would need a total rebranding to disassociate themselves from 
the previous boss' scandal. A new logo, a new vision, and lots of press 
coverage to be taken care of. As much as she had been tired of her normal job,
this fresh new challenge seemed exciting and worth taking on. After mitigating
the effects of the pyramid scheme, she began hiring new people, finding new 
clients, and working on expanding the business. She felt fulfilled in her
new role.
