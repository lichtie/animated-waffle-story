	Marianne was working in the corner of a cafe late on a Thursday night. 
She was meant to be working on the copy for a new client at her advertising
firm, but she had spent the past few hours frustratedly procrastinating. She
had, in truth, been spending her time doodling mindlessly in a MSPaint 
document. Over the years, her passion for her job had fallen, and she had 
found it harder and harder to keep her concentration. She knew that
eventually she would have to find a way to focus or she'd be fired, but that
didn't give any insight into how to do it. She put her laptop away and left
the cafe.
